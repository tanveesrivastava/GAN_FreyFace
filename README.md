# GAN on the Frey Face Dataset

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images similar to those in the Frey Face dataset. The GAN consists of a generator model that creates new face images and a discriminator model that distinguishes between real and fake images.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed to generate new data samples that mimic a given dataset. This project uses a GAN to generate grayscale face images similar to the Frey Face dataset.

The project includes:
- A generator model that learns to produce realistic face images.
- A discriminator model that evaluates the authenticity of generated images.
- A training loop that pits the generator against the discriminator in a zero-sum game.

## Dataset

The Frey Face dataset is a collection of face images captured from a video sequence. Each image is a 28x20 grayscale image, and the dataset includes 1,965 images. In this project, the images are normalized to the range [-1, 1] to facilitate training with GANs.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python and several Python libraries. The easiest way to set up the environment is to use `pip`.

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gan-frey-face.git
    cd gan-frey-face
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Download the Frey Face dataset (`frey_rawface.mat`) and place it in the project directory.

2. Run the script to train the GAN:
    ```bash
    python train_gan.py
    ```

3. The script will train the GAN and periodically output generated images to the console.

### Configuration

You can configure the training process by editing the `train_gan.py` script. Key parameters include:
- `epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `batch_size`: Size of each training batch.
- `learning_rate`: Learning rate for the optimizer.

## Results

The GAN will generate images similar to those in the Frey Face dataset. As training progresses, the quality of the generated images should improve, and you will start to see clearer facial features.
